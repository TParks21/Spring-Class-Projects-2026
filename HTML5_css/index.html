            Live To Ride
        </h2>
        <p> If this were an assignment to write all the reasons why I love bikes and how much
they mean to me, it would be a much longer project. Since it is only roughly 2
paragraphs, I will keep it short and sweet. I have grown up on the back/gas tank of a
bike ever since I could walk. My dad loved to ride, and he taught me what it felt like to
fly while being on the back of the bike. Growing up, I also had a moped that was a mini-
Honda. No, it wasn’t a Harley, but if he had found a moped that was a Harley, I would’ve
had it. To this day, we ride a Harley and will forever be a part of the amazing community
it brings with the name. Once you ride a Harley, you’ll never want to ride anything else
and you also Live to Ride and Ride to Live. .</p>

        <h3>PERSONAL</h3>
        <p>Within our local community, there are many different rides that are done
throughout the year to help raise money or support locals that just need a helping hand
or have had a death, and they need help raising funds for the funeral or unexpected
expenses. I have personally been on the receiving end of one of these rides for my dad
and it was an amazing outpouring of love from the community that was able to help with
different things. Aside from that, there are lots of beautiful places you can ride to and
the experience on a bike vs in a car is something magical. To name a few places you
can go to: The Tail of the Dragon, Sturgis, The Cherohala Skyway.</p>
