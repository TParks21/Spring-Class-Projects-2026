        <h3>Events with community</h3>
        <p>Events that surround this community and are done with thousands of bikes each
year, the main one would be The Trail of Tears Commemorative Motorcycle Ride. This
is an annual event that honors the memory and legacy of the thousands of Native
Americans forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands in the 1830s. It is one of the
largest organized motorcycle rides in the world, often drawing over 100,000 participants.
There are also lots of bike fests throughout the year in different states, but the biggest
one would have to be Bike Fest down in FL each year. There you can see so many
different unique bikes and some have been built from the ground up by some very

talented people..</p>
