    <p>The ocean and its life, supports biodiversity and contributes to global biodiversity.
The ecosystems within these waters, are home to a vast array of species. Oceans also
play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and climate regulation. Marine life is also a
food source for billions of people worldwide. Fisheries and tourism related to marine life

   <h1 style="text-align: center;">Maintaining our oceans ecosystems.</h1>

    
    <p>Marine life is an important part of our ecosystem within our waters and around
the world. If more people were more aware of the consequences of having to live
without the marine life, they would do more to protect the ocean and the animals within
it. I have been passionate about the ocean ever since I could remember. There are
many ways to support the effort to keep our oceans and beaches clean to help protect
the animals that call it home..</p>
