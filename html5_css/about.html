   <h3>Events Attended</h3>

<p>Events that surround this community and are done with thousands of bikes each year, 
    the main one would be The Trail of Tears Commemorative Motorcycle Ride. This is an annual event that honors the 
    memory and legacy of the thousands of Native Americans forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands in the 1830s. 
    It is one of the largest organized motorcycle rides in the world, often drawing over 100,000 participants. 
    There are also lots of bike fests throughout the year in different states, but the biggest one would have to be 
    Bike Fest down in FL each year. There you can see so many different unique bikes and some have been built from 
    the ground up by some very talented people.</p>
