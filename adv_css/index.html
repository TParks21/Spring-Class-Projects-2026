            <h2>Live to Ride</h2>
        <p>If this were an assignment to write all the reasons why I love bikes and how much they mean to me, it would be a much longer project. 
            Since it is only roughly 2 paragraphs, I will keep it short and sweet. I have grown up on the back/gas tank of a bike ever since I 
            could walk. My dad loved to ride, and he taught me what it felt like to fly while being on the back of the bike. Growing up, I also 
            had a moped that was a mini- Honda. No, it wasnt a Harley, but if he had found a moped that was a Harley, I wouldve had it. To this
             day, we ride a Harley and will forever be a part of the amazing community it brings with the name. Once you ride a Harley, youll never
              want to ride anything else and you also Live to Ride and Ride to Live. .</p>

   <h3>Personal Experience</h3>

<p>Within our local community, there are many different rides that are done throughout the year to help 
    raise money or support locals that just need a helping hand or have had a death, and they need help raising funds 
    for the funeral or unexpected expenses. I have personally been on the receiving end of one of these rides for my dad
  and it was an amazing outpouring of love from the community that was able to help with different things. Aside from that, 
  there are lots of beautiful places you can ride to and the experience on a bike vs in a car is something magical. To name a few places
     you can go to: The Tail of the Dragon, Sturgis, The Cherohala Skyway.</p>
